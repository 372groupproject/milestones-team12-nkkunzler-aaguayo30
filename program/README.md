# Project

This project is a Pac-Man stytle puzzle game where the objective is to move the player around the board and collection golden 'o's while trying to avoid the enemy 'E'. If your score becomes zero or the enemy hits you, you lose the game. Collect all the coins and you win, good luck, its harder than you think.

## Usage

* To start the game, run:  
```make main && ./main```

* To move around use the ASDW or HJKL keys.  
* To pause while in game, press the 'p' key.  

Good Luck!
